Hello World of Machine Learning - Classification of Iris Flowers.

Link to the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

This is a good project so start off because:

1. All the attributes are numeric .
2. It is a classification problem, allowing us to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
3. It is a multi-class classification problem.
4.All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.
